Pete,

the new versions will enable you to read in the two files into an array called bz_array,
which has 3 dimenions, x, y and time.
Use the following line while in idl.


  arr=kread_dave4vm(filename1='sotsp_20070829_022004.cdf',filename2='sotsp_20070829_035704.cdf')

Immediately after it does this it will crash in the part of the code which needs work,
ie line 101 and beyond in kread_dave4m.pro

Peter
